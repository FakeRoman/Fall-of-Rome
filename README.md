# Fall-of-Rome
Extremely underveloped and reskined units from in-game graphic mods
Adds the Western Roman Empire and some units from the late empire such as Limitanei,Exculcatores,Comitatenses,Exploratores,Auxilia,Magister Militum for a general (can also fight) and Foederati units, 
Several more units and factions are planned (if i learn how to add cities on the editor or through code, expect a campaign set in 457),
